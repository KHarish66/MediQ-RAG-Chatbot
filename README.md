Live Demo(This is where you should insert your demo GIF. After you create and upload it, replace the line below with the correct path to your GIF file.)‚ú® About The ProjectThis project addresses the challenge of accurately querying and retrieving information from dense, specialized documents. MediQ is an intelligent assistant whose knowledge is strictly limited to "The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine, Second Edition."It leverages a RAG architecture to ensure that all answers are grounded in the provided text, minimizing hallucinations and providing users with verifiable information. The system uses a state-of-the-art language model (Google Gemini) to understand questions and synthesize answers based on retrieved document chunks.üõ†Ô∏è Key FeaturesRAG Architecture: Ensures answers are based solely on the provided knowledge base.Specific Knowledge Base: Expertly trained on The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine.Interactive UI: A user-friendly chat interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.Source Verification: Displays the source document excerpts used to generate the answer, promoting transparency and trust.Efficient Vector Search: Uses FAISS for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant text chunks.üíª Technology StackBackend: PythonLLM Framework: LangChainLanguage Model: Google Gemini 1.5 FlashEmbeddings: Hugging Face sentence-transformersVector Store: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)UI: StreamlitüìÇ Project StructureMediQ-RAG-Chatbot/
